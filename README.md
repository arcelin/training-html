## Informations

I worked on this project with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). The extensions used are as follows:

- **Material Icon Theme:** icon pack extension.
- **Prettier:** code formatting and visualization extensions. For this project, I only used the CSS formatter, and kept the default ones offered by VS Code for HTML and JS.
- **markdownlint:** markdown formatting extension.
- **Live Server:** extension that automatically launches a local server and updates the content dynamically.
